# L4ughCtf

## Snake

the challenge is a .txt file, when you open it you will see a diffrent assembly code from usual
if you are not aware of python byte code you will take sometime to understand.
so using >> https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html i knew some instructions to start

in the following photo we can see fernet and base64 so it's almost encryption or decryption code

following line by line i came up with the orginal code as follows

running the code printed the flag
