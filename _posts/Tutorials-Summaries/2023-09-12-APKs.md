## Some Information and tools
Android Apps are usually written in Java and lately Kotlin started to be used too

android arch is linux-based which use user based protection. Thats mean every app is treated as a new user to prevent apps from interacting or spying on each other.
for this reason malwares will always try to gain root privilages.


android does not use JVM insted it has a dalvik virtual machine "DVM",
thats why google made DEX compiler that produce a dalvik byte code from the java byte code

the previous picture shows the ways to compile the java code.

APKs take the left route as we said


so if we want to decompile an apk back to java we need to convert that dex file "dalvik byte code" to java using tools like `dx2jar`.

google forced the app developers to write a manifest.xml file which descripe what does this app does beside any permission needed for this app so this file is considerd as the entry point for the analysis of any APK.

the main, launcher and splash activities in manifest file is also considerd to be the start point in the code so if you are not sure where to start just follow it.

we can extract it using `axmldec` or `APKtool`

## Advanced analysis

as any malware we analyse there are 2 ways for advanced static Disassembling and Decompilation

disassempling produce .smali files which needs deep understanding of this assembly instructions.

decompilation as we mentioned before we use `dex2jar` then any java decompiler that produces code very similar to the high level language.

pros and cones of each way are the same for any type of files

Now if we want to decompile it as i mentioned we will use the `dex2jar` tool and pass the dex classes to it then it will produce the .jar file

this .jar file will be decompiled using any java decompiler for example the `jd-gui` tool that is pre-installed on flare vm 

we can use `jadx` tool instead of the previous 2 steps

## emulation or virtualization

android virtualization not similar to linux or windows we usualy deal with the options are limited but there are too much details.

so each one need to check the best for the available resources.

for me i am currently using android studio emulator

android studio may slow down you laptop because it needs high resources to run like RAM, so if your laptob won't fit i recommend checking something else or download the `AVD` without the android studio or `qemu`.

we use `adb` commands to cntroll the app
