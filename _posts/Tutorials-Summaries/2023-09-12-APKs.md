java or kotlin

google made DEX compiler that produce Dalvik byte code from the java byte code 

android does not have jvm but have dalvik virtual machine DVM
شغال arm
we use dx2jar to convert the dalvik
user based protection from liunx كل اب بنسطبه يعني يوزر جديد عشان يعزل الابس عن بعضها

manifest.xml always exist to descripe the file and the permissions
axmldec to decode the xml files inside the apk

## Some Information and tools
Android Apps are usually written in Java and lately Kotlin started to be used too

android arch is linux-based which use user based protection. Thats mean every app is treated as a new user to prevent apps from interacting or spying on each other.
for this reason malwares will always try to gain root privilages.


android does not use JVM insted it has a dalvik virtual machine "DVM",
thats why google made DEX compiler that produce a dalvik byte code from the java byte code

![](dalvik.jpeg)

the previous picture shows the ways to compile the java code.

APKs take the left route as we said


so if we want to decompile an apk back to java we need to convert that dex file "dalvik byte code" to java using tools like `dx2jar`.

google forced the app developers to write a manifest.xml file which descripe what does this app does beside any permission needed for this app so this file is considerd as the entry point for the analysis of any APK.

we can extract it using `axmldec` or `APKtool`

## Advanced analysis

as any malware we analyse there are 2 ways for advanced static Disassembling and Decompilation

disassempling produce .smali files which needs deep understanding of this assembly instructions.

decompilation as we mentioned before we use `dex2jar` then any java decompiler that produces code very similar to the high level language.

pros and cones of each way are the same for any type of files

Now if we want to decompile it as i mentioned we will use the `dex2jar` tool and pass the dex classes to it then it will produce the .jar file

this .jar file will be decompiled using any java decompiler for example the `jd-gui` tool that is pre-installed on flare vm 

we can use `jadx` tool instead of the previous 2 steps

## emulation or virtualization

there are many options but i use android studio emulator

android studio may slow down you laptop because it needs high resources to run like RAM, so if your laptob won't fit i recommend checking something else or download thw AVD without the android studio.
